    	  	    <p>The recent years have witnessed the rapid growth of IoT (Internet
of Things) applications. A typical IoT application usually consists
of three essential parts: the device side, the cloud side, and
the client side. The development of a complete IoT application
is very difficult for non-expert developers because it involves
drastically different technologies and complex interactions between
different sides. Unlike traditional IoT development platforms
which use separate approaches for these three sides, we present
TinyLink 2.0, an integrated IoT development approach with a single
coherent language. It achieves high expressiveness for diverse
IoT applications by an enhanced IFTTT rule design and a virtual
sensor mechanism which helps developers express application
logic with machine learning. Moreover, TinyLink 2.0 optimizes
the IoT application performance by using both static and dynamic
optimizers, especially for resource-constrained IoT devices. We
implement TinyLink 2.0 and evaluate it with eight case studies, a
user study, and a detailed evaluation of the proposed programming
language as well as the performance optimizers. Results show that
TinyLink 2.0 can speed up IoT development significantly compared
with existing approaches from both industry and academia, while
still achieving high expressiveness.</p>

    	  	<p>With the increasing relevance of the Internet of Things
(IoT) and large-scale Location-Based Services (LBS), LoRa
localization has been attractive due to its low cost, low power
and long range properties. However, existing localization
approaches based on Received Signal Strength Indicator
(RSSI) are either easily affected by signal fading of different
land-cover types or labor-intensive. In this work, we propose
SateLoc, a LoRa localization system that utilizes satellite
images to generate virtual fingerprints. Specifically, SateLoc
first uses high-resolution satellite images to identify landcover
types. With the path loss parameters of each landcover
type, SateLoc can automatically generate a virtual
fingerprinting map for each gateway. We then propose a
novel multi-gateway combination strategy, which is weighted
by the environment interference of each gateway, to produce
a joint likelihood distribution for localization. We implement
SateLoc with commercial LoRa devices without any hardware
modification, and evaluate its performance in a 227,500m2
urban area. Experimental results show that SateLoc achieves
a median localization error of 47.1m, improving more than
40% compared to the state-of-the-art model-based approaches.
More importantly, compared to the fingerprinting-based
approach, SateLoc does not require the labor-intensive
fingerprint acquisition process.</p>

    	  	<p>Network tomography is an attractive methodology
for inferring internal network states from accumulated path
measurements between pairs of monitors. Motivated by previous
results that identifying all link metrics can require a large
number of monitors, we focus on calculating the performance
bounds of a set of interesting links, i.e., bound-based network
tomography. We develop an efficient solution to obtain the
tightest upper bounds and lower bounds of all interesting links
in an arbitrary network with a given set of end-to-end path
measurements. Based on this solution, we further propose an
algorithm to place new monitors over existing ones such that
the bounds of interesting links can be maximally tightened. We
theoretically prove the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms.
We implement the algorithms and conduct extensive experiments
based on real network topologies. Compared with state-of-theart
approaches, our algorithms can achieve 2.2-3.1 times more
reduction on the bound interval lengths of all interesting links
and reduce the number of placed monitors significantly in various
network settings.</p>

    	  	<p>Wearable-based human-computer interaction is a promising technology to enable various applications. This paper aims to
track the 3D posture of the entire limb, both wrist/ankle and elbow/knee, of a user wearing a smart device. This limb tracking
technology can trace the geometric motion of the limb, without introducing any training stage usually required in gesture
recognition approaches. Nonetheless, the tracked limb motion can also be used as a generic input for gesture-based applications.
The 3D posture of a limb is defined by the relative positions among main joints, e.g., shoulder, elbow and wrist for an arm.
When a smartwatch is worn on the wrist of a user, its position is affected by both elbow and shoulder motions. Given a single
point of sensor data from the smartwatch, it is challenging to infer the entire 3D posture. In this paper, we propose LimbMotion,
an accurate and real-time limb tracking system. The performance gain of LimbMotion comes from multiple key technologies,
including an accurate attitude estimator based on a novel two-step filter, fast acoustic ranging, and point-clouds-based positioning.
We implement LimbMotion and evaluate its performance using extensive experiments, including different gestures, different
moving speeds, different users and different limbs. Results show that LimbMotion achieves real-time tracking with a median
error of 7.5cm to 8.9cm, which outperforms the state-of-the-art [39] approach by about 32%.</p>

    	  	<p>Low-power and multihop wireless networking is
envisioned as a promising technology to achieve both energy
efficiency and easy deployment for many Internet of Things
(IoT) applications. Measuring packet-level path is crucial for
managing large-scale multihop wireless networks. Packet-level
path information encodes the routing path, a packet that takes
through a network. The availability of packet-level path information
can greatly facilitate many network management tasks. It is
challenging to reconstruct packet-level paths using a small overhead,
especially for large-scale networks. While there is a long
list of existing path reconstruction algorithms, these algorithms
focus on specific network scenarios, e.g., periodic monitoring networks
or event detection networks. There lacks a unified model
for systematically understanding and comparing the performance
of these algorithms in different network scenarios. In this paper,
we fill this gap by proposing an abstract model. Using this model,
it is possible to derive a decision space for selecting the best
algorithm for different networks. Furthermore, this model also
guides us to devise better path reconstruction algorithms (cPath_T,
cPath_S, and cPath_ST ) with respect to path reconstruction ratio.
Extensive experiments demonstrate the prediction power of our
model as well as the advantages of our proposed algorithms.
The results show that our algorithm (cPath_ST ) improves a
path reconstruction ratio from 94.4%, 34.3%, and 30.8% to
98.9%, 99.9%, and 60.1% on average in three network scenarios,
respectively, compared with the best state-of-the-art algorithms.</p>

The key ideaof TinyLink is to use atop-downapproach for designing boththe hardware and the software of IoT applications. Developerswrite the application code in a C-like language to specify thekey logic of their applications, without dealing with the detailsof the specific hardware components. Taking the applicationcode as input, TinyLink automatically generates the hardwareconfiguration as well as the binary program executable on thetarget hardware platform. TinyLink provides unified APIs forapplications to interact with the underlying hardware components.We implement TinyLink and evaluate its performance using real-world IoT applications. Results show that: (1) TinyLink achievesrapid development of IoT applications, reducing 52.58% of linesof code in average compared with traditional approaches; (2)TinyLink searches a much larger design space and thus can generatea superior solution for the hardware configuration, comparedwith the state-of-the-art approach; (3) TinyLink incurs acceptableoverhead in terms of execution time and program memory.</p>

    	  	<p>Cross-Technology Interference affects the operationof low-power ZigBee networks, especially under severe WiFiinterference. Accurate corruption estimation is very important toimprove the resilience of ZigBee transmissions. However, thereare many limitations in existing approaches such as low accuracy,high overhead, and requiring hardware modification. In thispaper, we propose an accurate corruption estimation approach,AccuEst, which utilizes per-byte SINR (Signal-to-Interference-and-Noise Ratio) to detect corruption. We combine the useof pilot symbols with per-byte SINR to improve corruptiondetection accuracy, especially in highly noisy environments (i.e.,noise and interference are at the same level). In addition, wedesign an adaptive pilot instrumentation scheme to strike agood balance between accuracy and overhead. We implementAccuEst on the TinyOS 2.1.1/TelosB platform and evaluate itsperformance through extensive experiments. Results show thatAccuEst improves corruption detection accuracy by 78.6% onaverage compared with state-of-the-art approach (i.e., CARE) inhighly noisy environments. In addition, AccuEst reduces pilotoverhead by 53.7% on average compared to the traditionalpilot-based approach.

    	  	<p>The ZigBee communication can be easily and severely interfered by Wi-Fi traffic. Error recovery, as an important means forZigBee to survive Wi-Fi interference, has been extensively studied in recent years. The existing works add upfront redundancy toin-packet blocks for recovering a certain number of random corruptions. Therefore the bursty nature of ZigBee in-packet corruptionsunder Wi-Fi interference is often considered harmful, since some blocks are full of errors which cannot be recovered and some blockshave no errors but still requiring redundancy. As a result, they often use interleaving to reshape the bursty errors, before applyingcomplex FEC codes to recover the re-shaped random distributed errors. In this paper, we take a different view that burstiness may behelpful. With burstiness, the in-packet corruptions are often consecutive and the requirement for error recovery is reduced as"recovering any k consecutive errors" instead of "recovering any random k errors". This lowered requirement allows us to design farmore efficient code than the existing FEC codes. Motivated by this implication, we exploit the corruption burstiness to design a simpleyet effective error recovery code using XOR operations (called ZiXOR). ZiXOR uses XOR code and the delay is significantly reduced.More, ZiXOR uses RSSI-hinted approach to detect in packet corruptions without CRC, incurring almost no extra transmissionoverhead. The testbed evaluation results show that ZiXOR outperforms the state-of-the-art works in terms of the throughput (by 47%) and latency (by 22%).</p>

In this paper, we present the design, implementation,and evaluation of Mosaic, a low cost urban PM2.5 monitoring system based on mobile sensing. In Mosaic, a small number of air quality monitoring nodes are deployed on city buses to measure air quality. Current low-cost particle sensors based on light-scattering, however, are vulnerable to airflow disturbance on moving vehicles. In order to address this problem, we build our air quality monitoring nodes, Mosaic-Nodes, with a novel constructive airflow-disturbance design based on a carefully tuned airflow structure and a GPS-assisted filtering method. Further, the buses used for system deployment are selected by a novel algorithm which achieves both high coverage and low computation overhead. The collected sensor data is also used to calculate the PM2.5 of locations without direct measurements by an existing inference model. We apply the Mosaic system in a testing urban area which includes more than 70 point-of-interests.

    	  	<p>Network  measurement,  which  provides  detailed information about the behaviors of operational networks, is essential for network management in wireless sensor networks. In the literature, there have been many approaches focusing on measuring individual aspect of the network, e.g., per-packet routing path and per-hop delay. However, there lacks a general support for conducting different measurement tasks. When managing an operational network, a network operator often needs to switch the current measurement task to a different one,in order to diagnose the observed symptoms. In this paper, we propose TinySDM, a software-defined  measurement  architecturefor WSNs. TinySDM provides a general support for conducting different measurement tasks. TinySDM defines a set of carefully selected hooks that allow the users to easily execute their own measurement tasks. In addition, TinySDM provides a C-like language called TinyCode Language (TCL) to enable easy customization of measurement tasks. By only transmitting the binary code of the measurement task, TinySDM significantly reduces the size of the disseminated data compared with existing reprogramming approaches. We implement TinySDM on theTinyOS/TelosB platform and evaluate its performance extensively in a testbed with 60 nodes. We also use TCL to implement four specific measurement tasks.

In addition, Elon prolongs the reprogrammable lifetime by a factor of 3.3.</p>
