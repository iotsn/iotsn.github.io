Recent years have witnessed many low-power wireless technologies, e.g., ZigBee, Bluetooth, LoRa, etc. These heterogeneous technologies raised several important research issues, such as how to combat against cross-technology interference, how to perform cross-technology communication without a gateway, how to interoperate over a wide range of IoT protocols. In this study, we aim to address several key issues in this field. Initial works have been reported in IEEE ICNP 2018, IEEE ICDCS 2017 and IEEE TMC.
