Modern IoT and mobile devices are equipped with a rich set of sensors, including accelerometer, gyroscope sensor, IMU sensor, acoustic sensor etc. Even the wireless module, traditionally used for communication, can be used as a sensing module (i.e., wireless sensing). The ubiquitous availabilty of these sensors, as well as the advances in signal processing and machine learning, give us unprecedented opportunities to better sense the physical world and human beings. In this study, we will focus on innovative applications and intelligent sensing techniques based on IMU, WiFi and millimeter-wave. Initial works have been published in UbiComp 2018 and UbiComp 2020.
