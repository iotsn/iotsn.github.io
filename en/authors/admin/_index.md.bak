The EmNets Lab at Zhejiang University focuses on issues in the area of IoT (Internet of Things) systems and networks. Distributed systems based on embedded platform allow for an instrumentation of the physical world at an unprecedented scale and density, thus enabling a new generation of monitoring and control applications. The current research interests of EmNets span a wide spectrum into IoT systems and networks, edge computing, low-power wireless networking, intelligent sensing and mobile computing. The EmNets group is headed by [Prof. Wei Dong](http://home.emnets.org:8888/dongw).
